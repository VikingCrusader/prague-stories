# Prague Stories

A gamified city-exploration app for Prague — built on the MERN stack and deployable as a PWA.

Discover hundreds of Prague landmarks, earn XP, level up, unlock achievements, and read trilingual descriptions in English, Czech, and Chinese(CN/TW). Go there. Stand there. The app notices.

**Live Demo:** https://prague-stories.vercel.app

## Key Features

### Exploration & Collection

- **300+ preset Prague locations** spanning every district and era — castles, cemeteries, Baroque churches, Cold War bunkers, a psychiatric hospital that hosts music festivals, and a confluence of two rivers that almost nobody visits
- **GPS-verified check-in** — the server validates you are within 200 m of the location (distance check skipped in `development` mode for local testing)
- **Automatic proximity detection** — a gold banner rises from the bottom of the screen when you walk within 100 m of an unvisited location; tap to collect
- **Instant grid refresh** after check-in; modal auto-closes after 2.5 s with XP and achievement summary
- **Undo check-in** (Uncollect) available on any collected card

### Guest Mode

- Unauthenticated visitors who follow a direct link are **automatically placed into guest mode** — no redirect to `/login`
- Guests can browse the full explore grid, map, guide, and read all location details
- Collect, add, and edit require a registered account

### Rarity System

Six tiers modelled on trading-card games, visible on every card border and diamond — even for locked cards:

| Tier      | Colour          | XP   | Who finds these                |
| --------- | --------------- | ---- | ------------------------------ |
| Common    | grey            | +10  | Anyone passing through         |
| Rare      | blue            | +20  | Smart tourists                 |
| Superior  | green `#2c8c03` | +30  | Curious visitors               |
| Epic      | purple          | +50  | Locals and enthusiasts         |
| Mythic    | orange          | +70  | Dedicated hunters              |
| Legendary | gold            | +100 | Prague's most iconic landmarks |

### Explore Grid

- Filter by **label** (stackable — e.g. Church + Hidden Gem simultaneously) or **rarity tier**
- Sort by **Distance** (closest first, default), **Newest** (recently added), or **Top Rarity**
- Live distance shown on each card ("340 m", "1.2 km")
- **My Collections** tab to review only unlocked cards
- Czech original name shown as a subtitle under the EN/ZH display name

### Interactive Map

- Leaflet map with gold (collected) and grey (locked) markers
- Sidebar shows square pixel art banner + "View Detail" button opening the full location modal
- Rarity filter available in the sidebar

### Gamification

### Location Cards

- **Trilingual descriptions** (EN / CZ / ZH) — handwritten long-form storytelling with historical depth, local humour, and 🥚 Easter eggs baked into selected cards
- **AI-generated pixel art** (Gemini) served as lossy WebP — one illustration per location
- **Lazy AI fallback** — if a description is missing, Gemini generates it on first detail view and saves it to the DB
- Wikipedia link and Google Maps navigation on every card
- Custom locations can be added by registered users with cover photo upload (JPEG/PNG/WebP → auto-converted to WebP via sharp → stored on Cloudinary)

### Localisation

Full UI in **English, Czech, and Chinese** — toggled via EN / CZ / ZH buttons in the navbar. All interface strings, label names, and location names switch accordingly.

In Chinese mode the UI switches to **[Ark Pixel Font (方舟像素字体)](https://github.com/TakWolf/ark-pixel-font)** — a CJK-compatible pixel typeface loaded from self-hosted woff2 files. Apple PingFang SC is the immediate fallback for mobile.

A **繁 / 简 toggle** appears when ZH is active, converting the entire UI (including DB description text) between Simplified and Traditional Chinese via [opencc-js](https://github.com/nk2028/opencc-js). The converter initialises lazily and the preference persists in `localStorage`.

### PWA

Installable as a standalone app on iOS and Android:

- **iPhone** — Safari → Share → Add to Home Screen
- **Android** — Chrome → ⋮ → Add to Home Screen
- Runs full-screen with no browser UI; tap the logo to force a version refresh (useful when there's no browser refresh button)

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- MongoDB (local or Atlas URI)
- [Google Gemini API key](https://aistudio.google.com/)
- Cloudinary account (for cover photo uploads in production)

### Setup

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
cd server && npm install
cd ../client && npm install

# 2. Configure environment
cp server/.env.example server/.env
# Fill in MONGO_URI, JWT_SECRET, GEMINI_API_KEY, CLOUDINARY_* (see below)

# 3. Seed locations
cd server && node src/data/seedLocations.js

# 4. Start the backend (port 5000)
npm run dev

# 5. Start the frontend (port 5173) — new terminal
cd ../client && npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:5173`, register an account, and start exploring.

> **Note:** GPS distance validation is skipped in `development` mode — you can test check-ins locally without being in Prague.

## Testing

Jest unit tests cover all pure-logic utilities. 98 tests across 5 suites — no database, no HTTP server, no React rendering required.

```bash
# Server (42 tests)
cd server && npm test

# Client (56 tests)
cd client && npm test
```

| Suite | What's covered |
| --- | --- |
| `rarityMap` | `RARITY_XP` constants, `getRarity()` slug lookup + unknown-slug default |
| `gamification` | `calculateLevel()` all 8 level thresholds, progress %, multilingual titles; `evaluateAchievements()` every predicate, deduplication |
| `locName` | `getLocName()` null safety, English passthrough, per-language fallback chain |
| `geolocation` | `haversineDistance()` known distances, symmetry; position cache, subscriber fan-out, unsubscribe, stale-cache bypass, navigator error paths |
| `pixelArtMap` | `getArt()` key hits, label fallback, array vs string, default; `LABEL_DEFINITIONS` shape; `LABEL_COLORS` hex format + coverage |
| `rarity` | `RARITY_XP` parity with server, `RARITY_COLOR` hex + spot-checks, `RARITY_LABEL` multilingual coverage |

Server tests use native ESM (`--experimental-vm-modules`). Client tests use Babel transform (`babel-jest`).
